It is not possible to reverse a simple singly linked list in less than O(n). 
A simple singly linked list can only be reversed in O(n) time using recursive and iterative methods. 

A doubly linked list with head and tail pointers while only requiring swapping the head and tail pointers 
which require lesser operations than a singly linked list can also not be done in less than O(n) 
since we need to traverse till the end of the list anyway to find the tail node.
