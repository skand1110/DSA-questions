//approach: using reverse linked list
/*
Reverse given linked list. For example, 1-> 9-> 9 -> 9 is converted to 9-> 9 -> 9 ->1.
Start traversing linked list from leftmost node and add 1 to it. If there is a carry, move to the next node. Keep moving to the next node while there is a carry.
Reverse modified linked list and return head.
