/*We have to paint n boards of length {A1, A2â€¦An}. There are k painters available and each takes 1 unit time to paint 1 unit of board. 
The problem is to find the minimum time to get this job done under the constraints that any painter will only paint continuous sections of boards, 
say board {2, 3, 4} or only board {1} or nothing but not board {2, 4, 5}.

We can observe that the problem can be broken down into: Given an array A of non-negative integers and a positive integer k, 
we have to divide A into k of fewer partitions such that the maximum sum of the elements in a partition, overall partitions is minimized.

One approach is using dynamic programming.
Another approach using binary search can be found as well. Refer 'allocate minimum number of pages' problem. Here we'll use the binary search approach.
