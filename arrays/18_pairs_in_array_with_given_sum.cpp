Use a hash map to solve the question in O(n) time. 

-> Create a map to store frequency of each number in the array. 
(Single traversal is required)
-> For every element check if it can be combined with any other element 
(other than itself!) to give the desired sum. Increment the counter accordingly. 
-> After completion of second traversal, weâ€™d have twice the required value 
stored in counter because every pair is counted two times. 
-> Also take care of pairs with duplicate elements like (2,2) when K =4.
